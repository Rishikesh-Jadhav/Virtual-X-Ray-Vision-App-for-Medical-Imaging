# Virtual-X-Ray-Vision-App-for-Medical-Imaging
This repository contains my project on medical image segmentation using the UW-Madison GI Tract dataset. It employs Segformer, and includes a Gradio app for user-friendly image inference. The model will be deployed on HuggingFace Spaces for easy accessibility, encouraging contributions to advance medical image segmentation in healthcare domain.
